## PlayAllVideos
I'm not a react developer, nor have I made discord plugins before, but I know some javascript.<br/>
I wanted to be able to share AV1 encoded videos on discord but they just refuse to support it for some reason, even though discord runs on electron which runs on chromium and chromium supports AV1 playback.<br/>
I didn't know how to start so I've taken the source code from similar project (Special thanks to [TheGreenPig](https://github.com/TheGreenPig/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/main/FileViewer)) and modified it to suit my needs.

The plugin let's you play any video that chromium supports<br/>
Tested containers: mkv, mp4, webm<br/>
Tested codecs: AV1<br/>
